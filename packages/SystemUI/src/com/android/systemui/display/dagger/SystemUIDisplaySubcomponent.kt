/**
 * Subcomponent for SysUI classes that should be instantiated once per display.
 *
 * All display specific classes should be provided with the @DisplayAware annotation. Once the
 * display is removed, [displayCoroutineScope] gets cancelled. This means that if classes have some
 * teardown step it should be executed when the scope is cancelled. Also note that the scope is
 * cancelled in the background, so any teardown logic should be threadsafe. Cancelling on the main
 * thread is not feasible as it would cause jank.
